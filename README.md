This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
# Assessment Prompt

The application, as you will soon see, required that I code two components, `<CircleSelector>` and `<Circles>`, and render them within the existing `<App>` component.

When the user clicks one of the four buttons in `<CircleSelector>`, the corresponding "circle" within the `<Circles>` component will be styled differently to make it appear "selected".

In addition, the button clicked within `<CircleSelector>` has its text changed and is also styled differently to make it look "selected" as well.

### GOAL

The goal of this assessment was to gauge my ability to develop a minimal ReactJS application that renders user-defined components, incorporating dynamic styling and reacts to some basic user interaction.
